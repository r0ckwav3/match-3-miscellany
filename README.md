# match-3-miscellany

Some match-3 mechanics I'm messing around with

## ideas
* Rotate 2x2 squares
* terra-battle-esque sliding (would have to balance this out somehow)

## todo
* implement power crystal ability
* add animation to bombs/cross bombs/power crystals (this could just be a picture that appears over the board when they activate)

## bugs
* None (that I know of)!
