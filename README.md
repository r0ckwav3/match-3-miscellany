# match-3-miscellany

Some match-3 mechanics I'm messing around with

## ideas
* Rotate 2x2 squares
* terra-battle-esque sliding (would have to balance this out somehow)

## todo
* implement power crystal ability
* add animation to bombs/cross bombs/power crystals (this could just be a picture that appears over the board when they activate)
* update bomb sprite to look more like a sea mine using draw_rotated_rect

## bugs
* power crystals cannot be spawened vertically in PowerMatch3.py
